The column details are:

MAKE - manufacturer name of the vehicle

MODEL - model name of the vehicle

VEHICLE CLASS - class of the vehicle like COMPACT, MID-SIZE, SUV and so on.

ENGINE SIZE (L) - the size of the engine in terms of the amount of fuel (in litres) the engine can hold

CYLINDERS - number of cylinders in the vehicle

FUEL CONSUMPTION CITY (L/100) - the amount of fuel (in litres) the vehicle consumes on city roads per 100km

FUEL CONSUMPTION HWY (L/100) - the amount of fuel (in litres) the vehicle consumes on highway roads per 100km

FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100) - the amount of fuel (in litres) the vehicle consumes on city roads and highway roads
                                combinedly per 100 km (55% city + 45% highway) 

FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (mpg) - the amount of fuel the vehicle consumes on city roads and highway roads
                              combinedly in miles per gallon (55% city + 45% highway) 

CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) - the amount of carbon dioxide (in grams) emitted by the vehicle on city roads and highway roads
                       combinedly per km (55% city + 45% highway)


Understanding the values in some of the columns:

MODEL : 4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive, AWD = All-wheel drive, FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle,
	SWB = Short wheelbase, LWB = Long wheelbase, EWB = Extended wheelbase

TRANSMISSION : A = Automatic, AM = Automated manual, AS = Automatic with select shift,
	       AV = Continuously variable, M = Manual, 3-10 = Number of gears

FUEL TYPE : X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel,
	    E = Ethanol (E85), N = Natural Gas


IMPORTANT NOTE : 
 
From model year 2015, vehicle manufacturers are using an improved testing procedure to determine the fuel consumption ratings of
new light-duty vehicles. The Government of Canada-approved new test methods that are more representative of typical driving conditions
and styles. The new test methods (5-cycle testing) supplement the standard (2-cycle) city and highway tests by integrating
three additional test cycles that account for air conditioner use, cold temperature operation, rapid acceleration and braking.
The new 5-cycle testing results in higher fuel consumption ratings that are more representative of a vehicleâ€™s on-road 
fuel consumption compared to the old ratings. To help you compare vehicles from different model years, the ratings for
1995-2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect the improved testing.
