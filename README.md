# CO2 Emission Prediction for Vehicles

## Description
* The project focuses on predicting the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by vehicles using various **Machine Learning** algorithms.<br>
* The prediction will allow vehicle manufacturers have an idea about the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the yet to be manufactured vehicles in future and manufacture them prudently.
<hr>

## Additional details
* There is one jupyter notebook in the project [co2-emission-prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/co2-emission/blob/master/co2-emission-prediction.ipynb) in which the Prediction has been done.<br>
* The notebook uses a dataset called [Fuel Consumption.xlsx](https://github.com/sagar-0817/co2-emission/blob/master/Fuel%20Consumption.xlsx).<br>
<hr>

## Running the notebook in local system
* A few libraries has to be installed in order to run the notebook in your local system.<br>
* Libraries required to run the notebook are mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/sagar-0817/co2-emission/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## Note

* You can also view the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) where you can run the notebook and make changes if you want without downloading
the notebook to your local system.
