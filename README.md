# CO2 Emission Prediction for Vehicles

## Description
* The project focuses on predicting the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by vehicles using various **Machine Learning** algorithms.<br>
* The prediction will allow vehicle manufacturers have an idea about the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the yet to be manufactured vehicles in future and manufacture them prudently.

## Additional details
* There is one jupyter notebook in the project [co2-emission-prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/co2-emission/blob/master/co2-emission-prediction.ipynb) in which the Prediction has been done.<br>
* The notebook uses a dataset called [Fuel Consumption.xlsx](https://github.com/sagar-0817/co2-emission/blob/master/Fuel%20Consumption.xlsx).<br>
* The dataset provides model-specific fuel consumption details and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for a large number of vehicles over many years in Canada.<br>
* The raw datasets were taken from the [Fuel Consumption ratings](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6) webpage of the official Canada Government open data website.<br>
* The dataset in this repository was compiled from the raw datasets taken from the mentioned website. The data is spread across three different time periods namely **1995-1999**, **2000-2014** and **2015-2020** in three different sheets of an Excel workbook.<br>
* You can view more details about the dataset in [about-the-data.txt](https://github.com/sagar-0817/co2-emission/blob/master/about-the-data.txt).

## Running the notebook in local system
* A few libraries has to be installed in order to run the notebook in your local system.<br>
* Libraries required to run the notebook are mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/sagar-0817/co2-emission/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## Note

* You can also view the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) where you can run the notebook and make changes if you want without downloading
the notebook to your local system.
